# TMDB Movie Data Analysis & Simple Recommender System  
This is my **Second Capstone** for Springboard's Data Science Career Track curriculum  
The project is split into three parts, beginning with data exploration to model building to recommendation engine  
 
### Motivation/Context   
My final undergraduate project was on Google’s Page Rank. Learning how a search engine works overlaps with discovering how a recommender system functions. Recommendation engines are everywhere from Spotify to YouTube to Amazon. After watching ‘The Social Dilemma’, more people are aware about how companies use personal data for their own benefit. What is a better way to understand how the mechanism works than trying to build it?
  
### Problem Statement  
Company XYZ is a video streaming platform that lets its members watch TV shows and movies without advertisements on any internet-connected device. Company XYZ wants to build a model based on movie attributes to recommend the right movie.
